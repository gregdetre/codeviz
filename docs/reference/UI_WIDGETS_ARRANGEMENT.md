### UI widgets arrangement

This document describes where interactive controls live in the CodeViz viewer and the rationale for their layout.

### Introduction

The viewer uses a three-pane grid: a left widget pane for controls, a central graph canvas, and a right details pane. This arrangement improves clarity and reduces visual clutter by moving the previously top-aligned toolbar into a persistent left column.

### Current state

- Left widget pane (`.toolbar`): layout selection, mode switching, edge/entity toggles, filter mode, refine button, and search. Test links removed in favor of integrated VS Code support.
- Center (`#cy`): Cytoscape.js graph with Cmd+Click/Ctrl+Click to open files in VS Code.
- Right details pane (`#details` within `.sidebar`): contextual information for the selected node or module, with VS Code integration via clickable file paths showing VS Code icons.

### Key files

- `ts/viewer/index.html`: Defines the three-column grid and widget markup. The toolbar remains identified by the same element IDs (e.g., `#layoutSelect`, `#modeSelect`, `#searchBox`).
- `ts/viewer/src/app.ts`: Wires control events by querying elements by ID. No behavioral changes are required due to the move.
- `ts/viewer/src/details-panel.ts`: Renders the right details pane with VS Code integration via clickable file paths with VS Code icons. For behaviour and states (overview, selection, groups), see `VIEWER_DETAILS_PANE.md`. For a concise UI summary, see `UI_RIGHT_DETAILS_PANE.md`.
- `ts/viewer/src/style.ts`: Cytoscape stylesheet for graph elements (unchanged by layout).

### Layout details

- Grid template: `var(--widgets-width) 1fr var(--sidebar-width)` with areas `toolbar graph sidebar`.
- The widget pane is vertical and scrollable; labels remain readable, and search expands full width.
- The right details pane remains resizable via the drag handle implemented in `ts/viewer/src/main.ts` using the `--sidebar-width` CSS variable.

### Principles, key decisions

- Prioritize a spacious, uncluttered canvas by relocating controls off the top bar.
- Preserve element IDs so scripts require no change and tests remain valid.
- Keep widgets keyboard-accessible and vertically grouped to reduce scanning effort.

### Future enhancements

- Collapsible widget groups (e.g., Layers, Layout, Search) with headings.
- Remember user preferences for toggles and layout in `viewer-config.json`.
- Optional compact mode for narrow screens.
