# Product Vision & Feature Requirements

## User Requirements (Verbatim)

> We're interested in features such as:
> - being able to group nodes (ideally nested), and move the entire group around, and expand/collapse as a group (e.g. nodes for functions grouped by file)
> - being able to filter (either to hide, fade, or disable some)
> - a mix of dynamic (e.g. force-directed) and fixed (absolute or relative) positions
> - interactivity (clicking to trigger custom actions), tooltips
> - and then various GUI

## Feature Priorities

1. **Node grouping**: Nested groups, group movement, expand/collapse (functions grouped by file)
2. **Filtering**: Hide, fade, or disable elements
3. **Mixed layouts**: Dynamic (force-directed) + fixed (absolute/relative) positioning
4. **Interactivity**: Custom click actions, tooltips
5. **GUI controls**: Various interface elements
